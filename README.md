# Kite v.1.0.0

## About the Game
Kite is a local multiplayer shooting game with a unique twist, built using Pygame and PyOpenGL. It’s a bullet hell shoot-up game where your opponent can control the enemies! The controls are simple, and both players use the same keyboard in different sections—Player 1 uses `WASD`, while Player 2 uses the arrow keys. This makes the game easy to play anywhere and fun to enjoy with friends.

The game assets were sourced from [itch.io](https://itch.io) and adjusted to fit the game’s style and mechanics.

**Note:** Unfortunately, the `.py` source files were lost during the process and are still being retrieved. Currently, only the executable (.exe) and assets are available.
